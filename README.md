Showcase site for hand-picked open-source projects by Spotify. It is built using Jekyll & GitHub Actions with a Node.js script to fetch data from the GitHub GraphQL API adding it to a static YAML file in the repository.

## Development

**Install Jekyll & bundler gems**

```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
```

**Install yarn**

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

**Install dependencies** inside of the project folder

```sh
yarn & bundle install
```

**Build & serve**

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

**(Optional) Test & update data**

[Create a personal GitHub Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to fetch & update the repository data locally. As the data is updated automatically using GitHub Actions `_data/projects_generated.yaml` should not be added to Git.

```sh
GH_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN node ./scripts/nightly.js
```
